# Changelog

What changed in each released version of Scrollio, newest first.

The part under a version's heading is what the update window shows to people who have an
older version, and what the GitHub release says: `scripts/release.sh` reads it. So write
it for the people who use the app, and give the version its part before you tag it.
`## Unreleased` collects what the next version brings; it becomes that version's part
(the heading gets the version) before the tag.

## Unreleased

- "You're up to date!" and a failed check are now the alert every Mac app shows, with
  Scrollio's icon and an OK button, instead of a notice at the top of the screen.
  Scrolling, buttons and gestures go on working while it is open.

## 1.0.1

- **Scrollio updates itself.** If you allow it, Scrollio asks GitHub once a day whether
  there is a newer version, shows what is new and installs it. General has the two
  switches and "Check Now"; "Check for Updates…" is in the menu bar menu and in the
  Scrollio menu.
- An update is installed only when it carries the author's signature; a download that
  does not is never opened.
- This is the first version that can update itself: from 1.0.0, download this one by hand.
- **Your settings in a file.** General › Settings file: "Export…" saves all your
  settings to one file, and "Import…" loads them from one, on this Mac or on another.
- Before an import Scrollio shows what the file holds, with everything its buttons,
  keys and gestures would do and every app, file or script they would open or run, and
  asks. Your settings from before each import are kept, the last five: "Restore…"
  brings one back.
- "Let Scrollio manage this mouse" and "Open at login" are not in a file: they stay as
  they are on each Mac.
- On macOS 26 and later the sidebar of the Settings window is grey again, not white.

## 1.0.0

First public release: smooth, trackpad-like scrolling for any mouse, actions for mouse
buttons and keys, mouse gestures, thumb wheel actions, and settings for Logitech MX mice.
